**Comments**

Phase 1 Comments:
Overall we enjoyed this first portion of the project. The process certianly was not easy, and we have a few takeaways from this experience. The first takeaway is that as a group we need to be better about starting early. The second is that css is quite a difficult portion of front-end development, and its use is pivital for a well designed website. We have css in place right now, and we are looking to clean it up and generalize the classNames for phase 2.

Another huge takeway was using git properly. We had a couple of incidents throughout the development process, but we think that we have almost got the hang of git, and are expecting less issues in Phase 2.

Phase 2 Comments:
Overall this phase was more challenging and required a lot more time out of each of us. The main API we were going to use for the Author information removed developer key access, therefore wwe had to scrape the information a lot of the information. We also ran into some issues when deploying with AWS. 

One main thing that we did differentely in this phase was creating a spreadsheet of all the tasks that needed to be done with deadlines and assigning people to tasks. This helped us stay more organized and visualize where other team members were at. 


Phase 3 Comments: 
https://gitlab.com/mehuldar/aroundtheworld/-/blob/splash-search/front-end/src/screens/Search/Search.js
Search Page inspired from Around the World

Overall this phase was a bit more challenging than we expected, but we ended up pulling through and finishing it up. Some of the most 
challenging portions were developing the front and back end at the same time, dealing with design decisions we previously made in the front-end, 
and adding highlighting on searches.

One improvement we made this phase was an effort to start early and plan ahead. This went great, but we still saved a bit of work for the end,
and were greatly helped by the extra day.

Moving into phase 4, we will try to clean up some of the front-end code, and we may touch the backend database to make the searching/sorting/filtering
more accurate with the data we web scrapped. 

Phase 4 Comments:
Code for visualizations inspired by:
Music Now 
https://gitlab.com/brandtswan/musicnow/-/tree/dev/frontend/src/views/Visualizations/OurVisualizations

Overall this phase was a bit more challenging than we expected. Given we are all at the end of the semester, we faced alot of issues with our free time and have really had to try to finish this phase up.

We fixed the pagination implementation from the last phase, added the visualizations, and made some other small changes. 

Leaving this project, there are a couple other small changes we would've liked to make, but overall we are super proud of the process and the final outcome!
