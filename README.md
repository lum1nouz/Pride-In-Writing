**Comments**

Phase 1 Comments:
Overall we enjoyed this first portion of the project. The process certianly was not easy, and we have a few takeaways from this experience. The first takeaway is that as a group we need to be better about starting early. The second is that css is quite a difficult portion of front-end development, and its use is pivital for a well designed website. We have css in place right now, and we are looking to clean it up and generalize the classNames for phase 2.

Another huge takeway was using git properly. We had a couple of incidents throughout the development process, but we think that we have almost got the hang of git, and are expecting less issues in Phase 2.

Phase 2 Comments:
Overall this phase was more challenging and required a lot more time out of each of us. The main API we were going to use for the Author information removed developer key access, therefore wwe had to scrape the information a lot of the information. We also ran into some issues when deploying with AWS. 

One main thing that we did differentely in this phase was creating a spreadsheet of all the tasks that needed to be done with deadlines and assigning people to tasks. This helped us stay more organized and visualize where other team members were at.
