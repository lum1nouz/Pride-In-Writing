Comments:
Overall we enjoyed this first portion of the project. The process certianly was not easy, and we have a few takeaways from this experience. The first takeaway is that as a group we need to be better about starting early. The second is that css is quite a difficult portion of front-end development, and its use is pivital for a well designed website. We have css in place right now, and we are looking to clean it up and generalize the classNames for phase 2.

Another huge takeway was using git properly. We had a couple of incidents throughout the development process, but we think that we have almost got the hang of git, and are expecting less issues in Phase 2.
